# Bright-Network-Internship-Experience
My attempt at tackling the Google coding worksheet for the 2021 Bright Network Internship Experience

I found this challenge incredibly difficult but really interesting! I had very basic experience with python before starting (hadn't used classes before) and as such only managed to implement 2 commands from part 1 of the worksheet. 
I feel as though I learnt a lot from just trying to figure out how the different parts of the code worked, however, and plan to continue learning about OOP and specifically python now that the experience has finished.
I may come back and complete more steps of this challenge in future for fun and to test myself when I have some more experience.

Thank you Google and Bright Network for providing this challenge!
